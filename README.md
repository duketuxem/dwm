# dwm

My personnal fork of dwm.

## Repository structure

This branch holds all the tweakings and the picked up patches.

The master branch is just a mirror from upstream that points to suckless git.
It does not contain any modification so to allow easy update from upstream,
that will later be merged to the custom branch.
